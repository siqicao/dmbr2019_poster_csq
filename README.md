## Abstract
People face different decision-making in daily life involving both oneself and others and interpersonal interaction affects people's decision-making progress. The pursuit of social acceptance is one of the most basic social needs. But social exclusion undermines the basic need of belonging to a social group and forming a positive and lasting social relationship. As a universally recognized social norm, fairness principle affects social communication. Generally, people praise and appreciate those who possess a high sense of fairness and dislike those who touch the bottom line of fairness.

The current study is designed to figure out how different types of group interaction (social exclusion/social inclusion) make contributions to social communication, meanwhile, to explore how interaction target(original partner/potential partner) influence people to make fairness-related decisions from the perspective of a third party in the social decision-making process. A visual ball-tossing game was used to manipulate social exclusion and social inclusion conditions. In a bid to eliminate the confounding effect of self-utility and fairness orientation, a novel revised TPUG(third party ultimatum game)was exploited to investigate the behavioral patterns. Our result is consistent with previous finding that fairness significantly affects rejection rate, more unfair proposals induce higher rejection rate. Besides, results indicate that the rejection rate of social inclusion is higher, which reflects their higher sense of fairness. In addition, different types of group interaction will both promote social interaction, and, to a certain extent, improve the individual susceptibility to the principle of fairness, the outcomes support the hypothesis of social reconnection hypothesis, however, findings also suggest different interaction types own selective concern. Those who are excluded are more concerned about the interests of the exclusion perpetrator, while those who are accepted care more about the status of potential partners. Therefore, previous interaction experience and potential development possibility influence human-friendly behavior.
